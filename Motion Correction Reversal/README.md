Requires: [Multipage TIFF stack - File Exchange - MATLAB Central](https://au.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/35684-multipage-tiff-stack)

This script will take motion corrected .tif files and use mclog.mat to revert them back to the original. Note that the metadata of the original .tif files is not stored in the motion corrected files, so this reversion process will not restore that metadata.

Is the metadata important? I've never used it before...
